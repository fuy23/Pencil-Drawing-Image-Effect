# Pencil_Drawing_Image_Effect
This repo is a course project for University of Washington EE 440 (Digital Image Processing)
It is a Matlab implementation of algorithm developed by The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

CAPTIONS:

Image Processing; Canny Edge Detection; Harris Corner Detection; Nonconvex Optimization;

DETAILS:

This is a image rendering system that creates a pencil drawing effect for any input image. 
It is improved based on existed algorithm. I preprocessed the image by feature extraction filter and applied the nonconvex optimization
algorithm to tone the input image a pencil drawing effect.
